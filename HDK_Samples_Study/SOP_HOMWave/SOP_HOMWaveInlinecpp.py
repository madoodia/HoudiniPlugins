# This SOP provides an example of a SOP implemented in Python that uses the
# inlinecpp module to speed it up with C++ embedded code.  See also
# SOP_HOMWave.py for a pure-Python implementation, SOP_HOMWave.C for an all-C++
# implementation using the HOM C++ API and SOP_CPPWave.C for an all-C++
# implementation using the HDK C++ API.
#

"""This is the accelerated equivalent of SOP_HOMWave.py.  It implements the
same SOP but runs approximately 40x faster.

To use this code,
    1) In Houdini, choose File -> New Operator Type
    2) Choose "Python Type"
    3) Choose the network type as "Geometry Operator"
    4) Paste this code in the "Code" tab of the type properties.
