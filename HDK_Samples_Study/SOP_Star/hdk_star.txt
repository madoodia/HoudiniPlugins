"""Creates a surface around curves using cross sections."""

== Overview ==

This node creates a surface with grid, tube, or torus topology around backbone curves from the first input, based on cross sections, either provided in the second input geometry or using the __Round Tube__, __Square Tube__, or __Ribbon__ options.  Alternatively, if no curve (first) input is provided, the cross sections in the second input will be surfaced.

The orientations applied to __Rows__ the cross sections are equivalent to those in the [Orientation Along Curve node|Node:sop/orientalongcurve].

@parameters

Divisions:
    #channels: /divs
    Number of points on the star
